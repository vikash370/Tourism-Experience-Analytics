## 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to empower tourism stakeholders with data-driven insights and personalized recommendations. It includes:

- **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):** Understand trends in ratings, visit modes, attraction types, and geography.
- **Regression Modeling:** Predict attraction ratings based on user behavior and location features.
- **Classification Modeling:** Predict the mode of visit (e.g., solo, family, group) using user and attraction metadata.
- **Recommendation System:**
  - **Collaborative Filtering:** Suggest attractions based on similar user preferences.
  - **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommend attractions with similar characteristics.
